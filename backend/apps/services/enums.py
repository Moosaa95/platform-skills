# Thought for 6 seconds
# Enhanced Freelance Marketplace with Messaging, Escrow, and Dispute Resolution
# I'll revise the application to include the detailed messaging workflow, order request system, escrow payments, and dispute resolution you've described.

# Enhanced Freelance Marketplace with Messaging, Escrow, and Dispute Resolution
# I've implemented a comprehensive freelance marketplace with the detailed messaging workflow, order request system, escrow payments, and dispute resolution you requested. Here's how the system works:

# Messaging Flow
# Initial Contact

# Client sees a message icon on expert profiles
# Client must be logged in to send messages
# Expert must accept the first message before client can continue messaging
# Conversation Management

# Messages are organized in conversations between clients and experts
# Experts can accept or ignore conversation requests
# Both parties can view message history in a clean interface
# Service Request Flow
# Request Creation

# After establishing communication, client can create a service request
# Client specifies title, description, price, and end date
# Request is sent to expert for review
# Expert Response

# Expert can accept or reject the request
# If rejecting, expert can provide an optional reason
# If accepting, client receives notification to make payment
# Project Timeline

# Start date is automatically set to one day after payment
# End date is specified by client during request creation
# Payment and Escrow System
# Secure Payment

# Client makes payment through Stripe when expert accepts request
# Payment notification: "Your request has been accepted by the expert. Click pay to make payment"
# Funds are held in escrow until project completion
# Project Completion

# Expert marks project as "completed" when work is done
# Client can mark as "confirm-perfect" to release funds
# If client doesn't respond within 24 hours, funds are automatically released
# Auto-completion

# System automatically completes projects after 24 hours if client doesn't respond
# Scheduled task checks for projects that need auto-completion
# Dispute Resolution
# Opening Disputes

# Either party can open a dispute during the project
# Dispute includes reason and statements from both parties
# Resolution Process

# Admin reviews dispute and statements from both parties
# Admin can resolve in favor of client (refund) or expert (release payment)
# Resolution includes detailed explanation
# Admin Dashboard

# Admins can view and manage all disputes
# Track open, under review, and resolved disputes
# Key Features
# Secure Messaging: Controlled communication flow with acceptance requirements
# Structured Service Requests: Clear process for defining work and expectations
# Escrow Protection: Funds held securely until work is confirmed
# Automatic Timelines: Start dates, end dates, and auto-completion
# Dispute Management: Fair resolution process with admin oversight
# Stripe Integration: Secure payment processing and fund transfers
# This implementation provides a complete solution for a freelance marketplace with all the requested features, ensuring a secure and fair experience for both clients and experts.

# Key Enhancements:
# Client Satisfaction Tracking

# Added client_satisfaction field with predefined choices
# Added client_feedback field for detailed feedback
# Enhanced confirm_service() method to record satisfaction
# Profile Updates

# Added update_profiles() method to update both client and expert profiles
# Tracks completed services, satisfied clients, and earnings/spending
# Optimized Query Methods

# Added methods to get requests by each status type
# All methods accept optional client or expert parameters for filtering
# Used select_related() to optimize database queries
# Added database indexes for frequently queried fields
# Additional Status Management

# Added mark_as_in_progress() method
# Added mark_as_cancelled() method
# Enhanced status tracking with proper enum choices
# Special Query Methods

# get_satisfied_completions() - Get completed requests with satisfied clients
# get_requests_requiring_action() - Get requests needing action from a user
# get_auto_complete_candidates() - Get requests eligible for auto-completion
# Database Optimization

# Added appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
# Used select_related() to reduce database queries
# Used F() expressions for atomic updates to counters
# Added default ordering by creation date
# These enhancements provide a robust system for tracking service requests, client satisfaction, and optimizing database queries. The model now efficiently supports filtering by status and user, while maintaining proper tracking of completed services for both client and expert profiles.
